# datagrapher

A simple way to quickly plot and examine csv (or similar) data from IoT sensors for analysing

This is built on top of many other awesome projects:
- [sass]()
- [Plotly.js]()
- [PapaParse]()

## Installation

```
$ npm install -g sass
$ make
```
Done! Now open `index.html`

## Usage

This is only meant to serve a specific purpose for a specific client, but for those who are curious this is how it works.
The input file HAS to have a UNIX timestamp as one of the columns. This will form the X-axis
